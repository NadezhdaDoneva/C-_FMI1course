Details about the project:
<br>

Rules:
<br>
Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. Safe squares have numbers telling you how many mines touch the square. You can use the number clues to solve the game by opening all of the safe squares. If you click on a mine you lose the game!
<br>
<br>
Instructions how to use the program:
<br>
 Firstly, you should enter the board dimensions (min size 3 and max size 10) and the number of mines (max 3 * board dimension)
 <br>
 After you should start entering your turns in this pattern: <operation> <xCoordinate> <yCoordinate>
 <br>
 The valid operation commands are "open", "mark", "unmark"
 <br>
 Enjoy and be careful not to hit a mine :)
